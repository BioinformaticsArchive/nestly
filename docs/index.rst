   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to nestly's documentation!
==================================

Nestly is a small package designed to ease running software with combinatorial

parameter choices, but can do much more-- arbitrary "backwards-looking"
dependencies can be used.

To find out more, look in the ``examples/`` subdirectory.
